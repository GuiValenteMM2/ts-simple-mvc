# ts-simple-mvc
Learning TypeScript while building a simple api;\
This project uses rest for crud operations;

# folder-structure
There is an app file for using the middleware;\
A folder for the model and business logic;\
A folder for the controller;

# main-entity
A todo item that have a name, description, due date and category;

# add-on-info
Initially, it's a project for operating crud on a JSON file storing todo items;\
It's open for a future implementation of a db;

# final thoughts
This project have a persistance layer and a controller layer, the app file consumes the middleware created in the controller layer;\
In the controller layer there is communication with the persistance where there are methods to be applied in the json file;
